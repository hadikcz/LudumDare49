# About game:
Small town, upon the river, has big problem. Electricty is very expensive, so most of citizens and factories, switch to oldschool steam heating and powering.
And your job is connect your heating plants with all houses and factories, by complex system of pipes, splitters, combiners and switches.

## Game was for compo, but I overshot the scope and not finished in given time. But everythink expect the 3 days work, is same as for compo, so no free assets, not free music. Everythink is 100% created within jam timspan. Thank you for understanding.

## Bugs
In game you can find some bugs around the pipe system, mostly when you will try destroy or disconnect pipes. I will do my best to try find it and fix it, without changing the anythink in the game.
